Life deals primarily with energy and agency (not literal life). Life isn’t giant bursts of energy, it’s more focused, neverending usage of it, like walking on a treadmill, and Life players’ worldviews tend to involve applying the usage of that energy, in a manner that depends on their class, to maximize their agency and ability to affect the world, such as a Witch of Life knowing exactly what to say to get, say, a little more money. However, if you asked a Life player to explain this shit to you, they wouldn’t be able to, because they don’t have the emotional priorities for that kind of thing (unless they’re a Seer, that might be able to pull off some magic. Not that we’ve ever had any). Life players have a fixation that is their class philosophy, as seen in the essay, but also they’re fundamentally very down-to-earth, grounded (literally) people. You ever met a genuine person who’s just like ‘hey I like cars’ and they like cars? Those are Life players.

Life players are catalysts, stabilizers who provide girders for moments of greater eccentricity. They make things a little more normal, and through their interactions with those of a weirder inclination, they allow both their own and the other character’s personalities to shine brighter. It’s actually really cool and can lead to some of my favorite character dynamics when written well, but Life players often tend to be a symptom of a crappy writer. In real life, Life players are just like any other person. They’re not defined by their Aspect, really, and you’ve probably been decent friends (if not great friends) with a Life player at least once in your life.
Together with Doom, Life and Doom make the axis of Energy on the Physical scale.
