Mind is about choice, control over your emotional reactions, decisions and the results of them, facades, the external self, social adaptation and very occasionally if caught on a good mood, ‘logic’.

Let’s get this out of the way first. Mind is not actually primarily facades. It’s more about decisions and your ‘persona’. To a Mind player, life is a series of decisions at every level, carefully considered. It’s Terezi’s coin flip - she says she’ll flip the coin and leave things up to chance, but in reality she’s made up her decision. Mind is also about the consequences of these decisions, and a process of reasoning that leads to the best one. It is not simply about the crossroads, it is where the crossroads leads you. Decisions come at every turn, they can be tiny, but greatly significant, such as whether to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a party invitation. Mind is the adaptation to a circumstance by control of your emotional reactions to it, and by weaving around how others perceive your personality to suit it, but not extremely so in response to every situation (something only Maids of Mind really do), the face you put on to suit the consequence you want.

In that sense, Mind can summed up in a couple of sentences. If you see what’s in your mind, and you understand the power that your thoughts have, then you understand reality while everyone else is running around confused and angry and upset, because they think reality is something that is happening to them, instead of something that they are making with every thought.

Together with Heart, Mind and Heart make the axis of Self on the Personal scale.
