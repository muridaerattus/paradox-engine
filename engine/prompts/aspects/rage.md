Rage is the singularity of possibilities, spite, animalistic instincts but especially fight-or-flight, fear and anger.

If Hope is many possibilities and the ability to choose between which one suits your tastes, then Rage is a singularity of possibility - the cutting down of all other possibilities, a narrow-minded, stubborn focus on just one, because a Rage player focuses on what they perceive as Reality, true and raw, in front of their eyes, completely undeniable. Rage players believe they are given a destiny by the cosmic forces, are told to move, and then push back with sheer spite and go “no, you move”.

Rage is primal instinct. It is fear, the terror of being hunted, rage is fight or flight. There is no room for things like doubt or even any true emotion other than pure fear. Rage is your very survival instinct, it can’t be boiled down to getting mad. It’s not anger or hate, it’s not passion, it’s will, the pure will to survive just one more day, to claw yourself out of a situation that you can’t deny, a situation that’s inescapable. To accomplish that, your brain shuts down everything that makes you you. It destroys reasoning, emotional instinct, pleasure, everything. No feelings, no thinking, only not being dead, that not being dead is your only choice and to deviate from that would be impossible, ridiculous. 

Short to say, Rage players are balls of anger who strike back with snarky insults and are perpetually sick of life because they’re filled with spite and constantly in fight or flight. They’re incredibly stubborn, and managing to get one to change their mind amicably will usually result in some unreal respect, if not outright loyalty. But don’t get me wrong, Rage players aren’t objective. Actually, it can be one of the more delusional Aspects out there. It’s not about actual objective reality, it’s about what they perceive as reality. And they’re sticking with it, because it’s true, and every other option means death.
And death, of course, is completely unreasonable.
Together with Hope, Rage and Hope make the axis of Possibility, on the Instinctual scale.
