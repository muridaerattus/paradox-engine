Time is about the inevitable march of time, emotional internalization, and the galaxy brain. Time players are acutely aware of how things are gonna play out in the long run, and internalize their emotions according to what they feel is best for the future. Most Time players generally are aware that most things do not matter, but how much that affects them emotionally depends on how unhealthy they are. In most cases, Time players have a worldview, but that worldview is ‘why isn’t there a meaning to life’, because Time has an inherent ‘meaningless’ feel to it. When healthier, Time is more about doing it to ‘em, and doing it to ‘em for years, and having the skills to do it to ‘em for years without messing up. Time players have the galaxy brain and are also involved in the social dynamics, but also tend to pick when to be actively involved and when not to be - they’re also subtler about it due to not yelling about the things they did, which can be seen in how Aradia, as admitted by Hussie, is more of a ‘secret leader’ of the Troll session, because she’s aware of how the trolls’ social dynamics can be exploited over a long period of time, as well as her own capabilities in doing so. By the way, Aradia and Dave lead to a sense that Time players are somehow emotionally repressive, but not really. Aradia just couldn’t feel emotions for a while and Dave postures a lot - emotional internalization is just about picking and choosing what to express at the moment, and I’ve met many outwardly happy Time players.

Time is also about destruction. Time players do not destroy by default, so this is more of a Homestuck thing. Inevitability, the sense that there’s nothing you can do to avoid certain things and that they should be planned and accounted for, the wasting away of everything beautiful and pure, that things only matter as they exist now and within a few hundred years nothing else will be left. If Space is creation, birth, the moment of inspiration, Time is destruction, death, the moment where it all ceases to be, and becomes an unrecognizable pile of sand and bones. Healthy Time players are, of course, not edgy about this at all - they’re fine with it, and enjoy life their own way, ‘cause it’s the only thing they’ve got. 
Weird phenomenon, but it seems like Time players are often caught using metaphoric speech and making things seem deeper than they really are.
Together with Space, Time and Space make the axis of Cardinality, operating on the level of the whole of Reality.
