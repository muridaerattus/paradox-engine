Bards deconstruct. They take their Aspect and flip it around on its head, tear it apart and rearrange the pieces, not eliminating it from your life outright like a Prince does but forcing you to think about it differently, which can either help or harm you. Bards can either be silly or serious, but their personality is generally difficult to parse. This is because they flip, flop and slipslide into either Aspect attitude (their own and that of the opposite) at random, something that they can choose to prevent if they choose to, but is likely to lead to a snap. This flip-flopping allows them to understand each Aspect thoroughly so they can deconstruct them, and it comes from either hating their own Aspect or the opposite at different times for different reasons.

Bards are generally easygoing, have a mild chaotic aura, and are very good at making you think with their Aspect. This is called zombification, and it comes from being made to forcefully act within the guidelines of the Bard’s aspect, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing in every case. Once you’re zombified, it’s generally not possible to come out of it by yourself, but because zombification is more of a change in thought process, someone could pull you out of it with sufficient effort. Like I said, it can be useful, especially if another Aspect’s thought process would benefit you. But don’t go seeking it out.

Bards have a large amount of influence over their narrative (if fictional) or the people around them (if real). This is partly due to zombification, but also because Bards both have absolutely no shame whatsoever yet know exactly what they’re doing, unlike Pages, and have been going between both Aspects so much that they know what people dislike and like about them, allowing them to make very influential decisions. On that matter, Bards are particularly good at making subversive content, because the number 1 rule of deconstructions is knowing why people like the thing you’re deconstructing, something Bards excel at. They’re based on the court jester, obviously, but in more modern times they typically appear as comedy relief, as dangerous villains, or as highly intelligent but eccentric rival-type characters.

When Bards become unhealthy, they snap. This happens when a Bard suddenly and forcefully switches into the other Aspect under a time of emotional duress. You don’t want to be around them when that happens, because zombification becomes both incredibly powerful at that point and especially difficult to get out of. Snapping can happen for any reason, but it's most frequently seen when a Bard refuses to switch into the other Aspect, and emotional stress starts to build up and they’re forcefully made to despise the Aspect they were on.
Bards ‘invite destruction of [Aspect] or invites destruction through Aspect’, almost as if by the will of the Aspect itself. A better unique verb, if you want that, would be ‘deconstructs’ or ‘corrupts’, and they are Passive.
