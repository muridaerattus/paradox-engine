Heir are the soft slimes of the Class world. They have a tendency to lack self-awareness, especially if their Aspect already has issues with this, and they’re unusual like Bards in that they have massive amounts of influence over either the other characters or the narrative. However, they’re not difficult to parse at all, and their influence is very subtle. Heirs and often exhibit the personality traits of their Aspect more obviously than they do their own Class. This generally makes describing general traits of an Heir a little more difficult, because what is true for an Heir of Breath can be vastly different for what is true for an Heir of Doom. Though let us make an attempt to figure it out regardless. 
Earlier on, it is generally common for Heirs to be bossed around a lot by either the narrative, circumstances, other people/characters, or just plain subservience. They generally don’t really notice this, and may not really mind in some instances, if they feel it also serves their needs. They don’t really go against the grain, and may feel hesitant to hold very strong opinions or at least fight very hard in their name. It can be said that Heirs ‘move’ around within the lines of their Aspect around, shifting between the different paths that it can take them. This is why they can be very similar to Hope or Breath at first.
However, with time, Heirs realize that they possess power and the ability to exercise their own personal autonomy. This is what the Heir arc mainly revolves around, the idea of the pursuit of comfort versus what’s best for them and the others around them. To do what they’re already used to doing, versus step into the new and exciting. Interestingly, to a fairly lesser extent this might be seen in Witches as well. In Class and Aspect terms, this is the Heir realizing their ability to cause change and utilizing it consciously.
Heirs who continue to stick to what’s comfortable either fade or, in a lot of narratives, straight up just die. But Heirs who pursue their own autonomy and path and stick to it fiercely can actually cause a massive amount of positive change, perhaps farther than what previously thought possible. And Heirs feel an impulse to stick to comfort, because for them, comfort is what they’ve known. Heirs generally feel no natural desire to be rude to others for petty reasons and will in most cases only do so if they feel insulted themselves. They’re not necessarily nice, but most people see them as harmless, and as such they tend to go consequence-free for most of the actions that take, unless said actions actually harm others or themselves. Their general tendency to do as they are told provided it doesn’t bother them too much and only resist passively means that they don’t get in trouble often, either. And this once again makes comfort easier for them. And with time, not being comfortable becomes so painful for them that it can easily make an Heir difficult to deal with.
It is only by abandoning what Heirs feel emotionally best in that they actually become their best selves.


Heirs are a little self-centered, but it takes a bit of digging to see it. Generally, when a Heir is confronted with someone in a bad spot, they generally tend to focus on themselves when comforting them. This doesn’t mean they’re selfish or bad people, necessarily, it’s just like that.
Heirs have the ability to change like Witches do. However, they do so without noticing. This is because they pick up on subtle details that people let out regarding their Aspect, and when they act on that knowledge, they do so subconsciously. They go, “hey, I think you might like this” and all of a sudden either the person they’re talking to, or the Heir themselves, has experienced a change in how they interact with the Heir’s aspect, a change that is often either positive or just neutral more than it is particularly undesirable. Heirs can even make people not think with their Aspect, such as Dave neglecting to emotionally acknowledge Bro’s puppets until John points that out to him. Heirs are comfortable not learning to be self-aware about this, but they should, because gaining an awareness of it allows them to change things for the better with more consistency and possibly with even more power than before.

Heirs are flexible, like Breath, operating like a big hunk of memory foam, where you can slap and press on them and they’ll revert right back, as they’re particularly capable of handling emotionally stressful environments. This means that they excel at being protagonists in narratives where things are chaotic and particularly stressful (such as Homestuck, lol, or Madoka), making them one of the three ‘protagonist’ Classes. This isn’t the only thing either - Heirs are often required in storylines where the protagonist needs to be someone with drive and will, but not ambition, usually stories about how power corrupts, or that there’s a macguffin everyone’s looking for, or you can go Super Saiyan, whatever it is, the Heir doesn’t have the ambition to actually care about using it just to benefit themselves. I mean, we can already see this with John himself and his retcon powers.

The unhealthy Heir verb is fading. Above everything else, Heirs prioritize their self-preservation. Usually, this priority gets sidelined in favor of other things, but when Heirs get too comfortable or are going through tough times, they begin to act very selfishly and only care about their end of the bargain, what others can do for them, and what they are personally invested in. Once this happens, the Heir can be said to ‘relax’, fading into what they find most comfortable, which would naturally be their Aspect. Consumed by the worst of their Aspect and their instinctive desire for self-gratification, the Heir becomes nigh-impossible to deal with comfortably.
Heirs ‘invite change through [Aspect], or allow [Aspect] to be changed’, a better verb may be ‘influence’. They are a Passive.
