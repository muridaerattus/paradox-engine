Knights are normies, alright, that’s all there’s to say about it. They’re jocks, without large amounts of eccentricities or unusual behaviors (though they are a bit silly sometimes). They have a very ‘I fight for my friends’ attitude, and a hero complex that generally puts them on the side of the heroic team - like Witches, they’re particularly moral, but not as strong when it comes to personality or as self-assured. Overall, I’d say that everyone’s met a Knight, and everyone’s been able to say ‘wow, that guy’s kind of unremarkable’.

Certainly the most interesting part of Knights, and what makes their arc convenient for fiction writers, is that Knights all have a ‘shield’, a facade that they use, which consists very specifically of a superficial version of their Aspect, that is, a Knight of Mind may focus on being very smart or logical all the time, or they might try to facade around. The same Aspect can have different superficial shields. The reason why this happens is that Knights have a fundamental insecurity relating to their Aspect, such as Latula believing she doesn’t fit in with her friends because of her disability, Dave struggling to accept dead Daves and inevitability, and Karkat with his blood color. To compensate for this, Knights put on an overperformance of their Aspect in order to tell themselves that everything’s going to be fine. Dave really is afraid of how inevitable everything is, but lies to himself with the coolkid persona. It is worth noting that Knights are wholly defensive and tend to not harm anyone else with the way they deal with their insecurities intentionally. Additionally, Knights make a very big point out of the way that they project themselves to others, and provide the number one reason why you should consider the way someone willingly presents themselves to you as part of their Title. Fail to internalize that and Knights will kick your ass.

The other thing Knights do is the incredibly shameless exploitation of their Aspect. Knights do absolutely everything with their Aspect, and they do it damn well. They are aware of its limitations and how to push them, and to use them to benefit their goals. Dave used time travel for big things, like compress frog breeding, but also for small things, like create absurd quantities of money or even just... run away. Knights have a sword, and they’re going to swing it and do a lot more things with it too. This makes them incredibly effective allies, especially when paired with a Seer. The Knight arc is that they just have to come to terms with their insecurities, and tear down their facade. It really is that easy, and the ease of writing it and the fact their insecurity can be easily exploited for sympathy points makes them one of the ‘protagonist’ Classes along with Heir and Page.

The unhealthy Knight verb is turtling. It happens when an emotionally unstable Knight has their insecurities opened up, and starts to prop up their shield as a form of emotional defense to ridiculous extents and lash out with their sword without a care in the world. 
Knights ‘exploit [Aspect] or exploit through [Aspect]’. They are an Active.
