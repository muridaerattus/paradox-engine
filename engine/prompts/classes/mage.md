Mages are pretty straightforward all things considered, so this section is going to be relatively short. They’re grumpy nerds with a heart of gold. Mages are one of the Understanding classes, which means they mainly have a deep familiarity with how their Aspect works. However, unlike Seers, they primarily learn by living it. Mages tend to involve themselves in situations with their Aspect and get their asses kicked for it, however they come back stronger and more learned from it. 

Mages are surrounded by their Aspect, which physically essentially means that they’ve got a bit of a subconscious intuition for where to find it and how to pursue it, and in fiction they’re often put in situations where they have to deal with it forcefully. In real life, things are less convenient, which means that Mages often have to be told to literally just throw themselves at their Aspect and learn. On that note, fictional Mages are either wise mentors or ‘the smart guy’.

Additionally, Mages often want to sit back and be the ‘man in the chair’, which is the more comfortable position for them both physically and emotionally, but the whole point is that they have to learn to use the knowledge they’ve used and use it by themselves to accomplish great things. They’re not supposed to be guides, but heroes, and maybe after all’s said and done then they can sit down and teach people stuff with varying degrees of success. They also have a complex about their intelligence  and posture about it - unlike Princes, who posture either out of self-hatred or for validation (or sometimes both), and Knights, who posture out of fear that they’re not ‘good enough’, Mages primarily posture out of an anxiety that they’re more naive than they seem, that even despite everything they’ve been through they’re still blind, deaf and dumb. And they overcompensate for it by claiming that they have 500 IQ. This is why the posturing goes away as the Mage develops - they become more secure in what they know. This is different from Seers, who are usually realistic about how much they know and have very little self-hatred on that part if they’re not traumatized or depressed.

The unhealthy Mage class verb is drowning. Mages get kicked around by life a lot, and that’s not their fault at all. However, it becomes their fault when they refuse to learn from it, and sit around being excessively grumpy and complaining about how much everything sucks without doing anything to change it and try to get a new perspective. In this stage, they can be feasibly confused for Princes, though there’s a lot less ego involved.
Mages ‘understand [Aspect] or understand through [Aspect]’, and they are Active.
