Maids, even the male ones, are based on a very specific archetype - the ideal Victorian companion, the ‘angel in the house’, expected to be “passive and powerless, meek, charming, graceful, sympathetic, self-sacrificing, pious, and above all--pure.” This is true -- at least, of early Maids -- but not ideal.

Maids start out as doormats. Not the kind of doormats that Heirs are - but the kind that does what they’re expected to do. They don’t understand how to generate their Aspect, and gain their definition and the Aspect itself from an exterior source. Family, their culture, friends, maybe even a heritage. A Maid can have multiple sources for their Aspect at the same time, or even abandon a source and gain a new one, but the change is not nearly that radical. For example, a Maid of Mind will generally adapt their personality radically towards the mood of a certain room, but they won’t change themselves for each single individual they meet. 

The whole point, however, is for Maids to not be perfect companion. They’re not meant to be passive and powerless, meek and charming. Maids don’t exist for others - they exist for themselves. And they know this, because being a doormat stresses them out. Maids all want to go crazy, because they passively accumulate stress from being stepped on, and the only tolerate it, because they feel they can’t afford to step out of line. Going crazy is not the best idea, don’t get me wrong, but Maids do have to stand up for themselves. And the way that they can do that is to take a stand, live for themselves, and define their Aspect as their own thing, which they can then begin generating. And generate it they will - Maids who’ve managed to grow beyond the doormat stage are incredibly powerful reservoirs of their Aspect. They’re downright terrifying (though they can certainly be so before then, as well), present their Aspect strongly, and can hit you with it harder than a Witch can.

Once that’s a done, a Maid can choose their own path in life. The point is for them to choose, not for someone else to choose for them. Besides that, Maids are stubborn, like to banter, enjoy going crazy, and are known for being occasionally silly. The previously mentioned stubbornness can be a serious pain in the ass sometimes, but basically because arguments with stubborn Maids basically boil down to this, though with a slightly higher IQ quotient.

It is worth noting that something as important to Maids as the fact that they rely on their environment for their Aspect is the fact that Maids put up a front of being much stronger and alright with things than they actually are, repressing their negative emotions and making bad situations seem like much less of a bigger deal than they actually are. Maids often have a great fear of being weak, useless, or ‘seen’, but are actually incredibly stubborn and determined. Maids are strong and often intelligent, but hardly believe themselves to be. Maids are also often aware that they rely on their environment and often wish they didn’t, some Maids even expressing a desire to keep that fact as hidden as possible. This means that Maids are very emotionally repressed (Maid of Doom easily being the most emotionally deadpan Title there is, being extremely straightforward and no-nonsense) and unwilling to ask for help even when they really need it.

They also like to keep their Aspect ‘tidy’, not necessarily fixing it like Sylphs do, but maintaining to a state where they feel it can be made the best out of, an example of this being Porrim’s feminist activity (Space = social dynamics) and Aradia being a psychopomp kinnie.
The unhealthy Maid class verb is exploding. Maids tend to accumulate stress when it gets too much to bear. The Maid goes all out with their Aspect and hits everyone near them as a way to vent out all the shit they’ve been wordlessly taking. It’s pretty raw, and absolutely terrifying.

Maids ‘create [Aspect] or create through [Aspect]’, and they are Active.
