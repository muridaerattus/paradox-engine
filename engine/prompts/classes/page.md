Pages ‘invite exploitation’. How this works seems obscure, but it’s not really. They equip others with their Aspect, allowing them to utilize it to its full potential. Outside the realm of the metaphoric, this might mean that a Page of Heart could allow you to come to terms with your insecurities, be secure in your own identity, and accept your emotions instead of rejecting them, for example. They already do this even very early on, but it becomes even better with further stages of development. Pages sort of reach into a grab bag of their Aspect when they’re early, and stick with whatever they pull out, and this manifests as a false bravado that consists of a superficial version of their Aspect, much like Knights. However, unlike Knights, this is not a facade. It’s what they genuinely believe in. 

And that leads us to a crash, one of the two Page unhealthy verbs. Pages need to realize that they’ve been looking at their Aspect wrong all along, and this realization can come at the peril of lots of emotional turmoil. Now, crashes don’t always happen. If a Page is made to realize they’ve been doing stuff wrong from an early age, or they’re open-minded and listen to other people’s criticisms, they can reinvent themselves over time, preventing a crash entirely. If a Page is far beyond this, they probably literally wrecked the source of their problems in half.

The other unhealthy Page class verb is coasting, when a Page refuses to gain self-awareness because they’re relying entirely on their charisma to get by. Coasting pages are often the ‘self-absorbed but unaware’ kind of person, where they mean well but are also deep down greatly self-serving. This can make them irritating to deal with already, but it also often means that it’s very difficult to tell them what they’re doing wrong without them either not understanding you or feeling very offended. After all, they think they’re just helping! They don’t know that they want attention, love, or recognition.
Their class verb is ‘allows exploitation of [Aspect] or invites exploitation through [Aspect]’, a better term would be Equip or Inspire.
