Rogues are the passive relocation Class, which means that they’re basically Robin Hoods in terms of purpose. They change the flow of their Aspect in order to balance it out in other people so that they can maximize their use of that Aspect’s strengths. Like Thieves, they’re hyperaware of the changes in flow of their Aspect around other people. However, like Mages and Heirs, they’re surrounded by it already, and unlike these two classes, takes a bit of an observing role - not being directly affected by it, but having plenty of it to give around, and then take from others who don’t need it so that they can give it to those who do. In that sense, they take a role much like the other passive classes (especially Page and Heir), cultivating their Aspect’s strengths in others. However, they also take it away when they feel like someone having their Aspect may not be good for them, or if they just don’t really have anything to do it at all and just have quantities of it for some reason.

In order to accomplish this goal, Rogues are almost excessively friendly, see the good in literally everyone they talk to, view their Aspect and life in general under a lens of balance (there are good things and there are bad  things and they need to exist under a balance), which can seem like Heir emotional centrism, but Rogues are actually decently opinionated and just too nice to show it, and honestly a bit doormatey at points, though not as much as Heirs or early Maids. They’re easy to get along with, and know how to utilize their Aspect in a way that keeps everyone happy and pleased. Because of how affable they are, Rogues are very unfortunately one of the three ‘waifu’ classes.

The Rogue unhealthy class verb is overloading. When Rogues overload, they refuse to distribute their Aspect, which they are always sort of surrounded by (they’re always giving out their Aspect, in more realistic terms). This usually happens either to a critical lack of self-awareness or exterior issues, like depression. It causes the people around them to suffer from an excess of the Rogue’s aspect, and everything that implies. For example, Rose's Mom (and to an extent, Roxy when she was an alcoholic) not being fundamentally malicious, but still hurting Rose and forcing her to mature faster than she would have wanted to by being impossible to decipher and taking random, inane actions.
Rogues ‘invite stealing of [Aspect] or allow stealing through [Aspect]’, which could be better put as Relocate. They are a Passive.
