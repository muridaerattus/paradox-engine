Thieves are the kind that’s self-assured, knows what they want, and doesn’t spend their whole lives brooding. Thieves, of course, primarily take their Aspect from others, a process relatively easy to understand. But the deeper intricacies of it are more interesting. Essentially, Thieves weave the flow of their Aspect around - a Thief of Light, yes, could, on a superficial level, take all of the attention for themselves, which is something Vriska does. However, they can also use that Light to prop up others, by ensuring their opinions are heard, if healthy enough. “Hey, this is MY friend, and because they’re MY friend, you should pay attention to what they have to say”.

Thieves place a lot of emphasis on their own opinions and interests. Strictly speaking this is not a bad thing provided they’re healthy, but society damn well hates it. This leads to a lot of daily microaggressions from literally everybody, because the fact you’re looking out for what’s you and yours means that people won’t take it well, no matter how subtly done. It’s not a bad thing to have confidence, and for Thieves that confidence shouldn’t be imposing - if it is, that’s a mark they’re unhealthy. It’s a form of protection, because people often devalue looking out for yourself, especially in a trauma situation. And not only that, but Thieves are fundamentally motivated by fear. In order to avoid admitting that they’re scared, Thieves play up their own ego. You can tell how bothered by something a Thief is by how much they’re playing up themselves. In order to help them, you sort of have to aggressively believe in them, because they don’t think themselves worthy of respect or love. It may seem like a Thief is invulnerable and thinks highly of themselves, but often that’s not true at all. Often, they look towards other people for support, and simply hide behind a shield of faux-narcissism and a self-serving attitude. It’s the only way they know to deal with their fear and their desire to be loved and accepted by a world they believe loathes them and wants them dead.

To fully understand how Thieves work, imagine there’s a big ball of wibbly wobbly Aspect stuff surrounding everyone, of all 12 Aspects, most strongly the Aspect that person belongs to. In some parts, it’s naturally stronger, and in other parts, it’s naturally weaker. If you’re a Thief, you’re hyper aware of these variations, which can be personally stressful, especially if you believe that you don’t have a lot of it (which Thieves at the beginning absolutely do), which makes you want to take it from others, right. It’s their job to both develop their own morality, appreciate others for being them, and use these imbalances to their own advantage. 

Thieves present their Aspect strongly, and you’ll usually be able to tell which Aspect a Thief is by lookin’ at em. Or maybe they’ll a sing musical number about how great they are, or something. They stockpile large amounts of it because (when early) they both believe they don’t have enough of it and that they strongly believe in its power. And, of course, Thieves do  have fundamental insecurities that they keep covered up under the personal defense of being very self-assured, which is NOT like a Knight shield because they aren’t overcompensating, they’re just not showing you how scared they really are, something they’ll very rarely admit to anybody they’re not truly and completely close to. If a Thief opens up to you emotionally, pat yourself in the back - you have yourself a loyal servant.

The unhealthy Thief verb is surrendering, which comes in two forms. Thieves can surrender to their own Thief nature, which essentially means they start stealing with impunity and act like massive egotistical bastards, not because they’re evil but generally to cover their insecurities getting a bit out of control, like Vriska suffering from a combination of custodian-related trauma, wanting her life to be as cool as the Marquise, and having her insecurities regarding Alternia’s systems really fuck her up. Thieves can also surrender their Aspect away, which means that they essentially try to stop relocating their Aspect to themselves, which is unhealthy as they need to do so to maintain self-confidence. They begin to turn into a doormat, and let themselves be trampled upon. This and the other type of Surrendering go hand in hand, as it seems to come mostly from a realization of ‘Wow, I was terrible’, similar to Prince self-shattering.
Thieves ‘steal [Aspect] or steal through [Aspect]’, and they are Active.
