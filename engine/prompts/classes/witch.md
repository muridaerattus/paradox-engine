Witch is one of these classes that is really easy to understand but a bit of a pain to find your footing with when you’re trying to explain it to somebody else. First, it’s worth noting that Witches have a very dominating presence, probably the Class with the biggest force of personality, and that Witches both have very few Aspect related insecurities (not to say they aren’t insecure, but they also bottle it up a lot) and very rarely mess up when sticking to their lane and applying it, unlike say, Mages, who need to learn from experience how to apply their Aspect, or Princes, who have massive reservoirs of their Aspect but are 24/7 lashing out at it. Essentially, Witches think they've come out of the womb already ‘done’, so to speak.

Witches change. That is, they manipulate their Aspect to achieve their goals, and manipulate the flow of that Aspect to make a better environment for it and for themselves, and they do so through asserting their personality to do so. Witches are confident in their ability to manipulate their Aspect (you can change), are aware of their limitations and ability and are able to use it with a very high success rate to right wrongs (you can change), and have a deep-rooted sense of morality and duty (you must change). If Witches already have a lot of morality and want to make the world better, why would they be bad? Simple - by being too strong about it.

Witches that haven’t developed want to make things better, and often do, but they do so with impunity and great strength. People around them aren’t prepared to receive that sort of treatment, especially if they’re Grimdark (another word for the unhealthy class verb), which can cause emotional turmoil in the people they’re whammying (see the blue link above). This is why the nudging method is particularly effective, and something Witches need to learn to use more. It is entirely possible for a Witch to go ‘hey you know you’re being an idiot’ to somebody and drive that into their head until they have a stressed out meltdown. Additionally, it is entirely possible for Witches to go on ego trips (directly related to Grimdark) and only use their power to benefit themselves and fuck everybody else, which is how Witches can be villains in works of fiction, something really only common in Victorian literature and rarer nowadays, though it still happens. The good Witch knows when to step back, when to let go of a situation and let things just happen.

Besides that, Witches are generally pretty fun to hang out with. They may have a pretty strong force of personality, but they’re also generally friendly (which can make them seem absolutely terrifying, but don’t worry, they mean no harm most of the time), and tend to go under the ‘excited genki girl’ archetype, so chances are if you’ve met a healthy Witch they’re likely easy to get along. That being said, it’s probably not a good idea to get on one’s bad side, because they can and will fuck you up if they perceive you as a threat or as a wrong to be righted.

The Witch unhealthy verb is unbalancing. This can happen in two ways - either the Witch is too overinvolved and ends up violently whammying everyone else around them with an Aspect hammer, which as described above is not good, or the Witch ends up being traumatized out of believing that she can change in any way, which leads to an underinvolved Witch. Of course, trauma isn’t the only one way underinvolved Witches can happen - sometimes their sense to tell when a situation is wrong is skewed.
Witches ‘change [Aspect] or change through [Aspect]’, and they are Active.
