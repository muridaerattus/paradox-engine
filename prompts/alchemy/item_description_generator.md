<INSTRUCTIONS>
Write a short 1-2 sentence snappy and funny description of a new item given its name.

"AND" is an operation that creates a new object strengthening the qualities that both predecessor items share, while reducing the qualities not shared by either.
"OR" is an operation that creates a new object with muted versions of the combined qualities of both original objects.
"new item" just makes a new item. No predecessor items.
