Blood is the Aspect of ‘I fight for my friends’. It’s about social bonds, social responsibility, emotional dwelling, and the will of the many overpowering the will of the one. Blood is what ties you down when you fly off into dangerous situations, it is about what you have done and will do for your friends and society, because the former care about you and you care about them, and the latter because it needs you (and many others) to function. It is the realization that even if you’re weak on your own, you can ally with others, and count on them to help. It is the acknowledgement of the things that make you feel, the darkness of the world, because flying away from all that means becoming complacent. It’s not about what you want, it’s about what you need to do. Blood are the high rise buildings of New York, and Breath is Spider-Man jumping off of them.

Social duty, what you ought to do. To chain (lol) yourself to your connections, and maintain them because by existing, the people you’re with give you a reason to live. To keep going one more day, because you’re doing it for them. To see them happy, to see this world stable and functioning, to keep the gears spinning, the clock ticking. To rise up against the selfish tyrant, to arm those around you and lead them to victory with a war cry. The great warrior-general of the plains is as much a Blood player as the stressed out but friendly office worker who works overtime and would do an excellent boss if society didn’t prioritize who knew how to get money and get money quick. It’s about promises, a ‘blood oath’ that you shouldn’t break because it means betraying someone else’s trust, destabilizing the relationship, corrupting the order. A promise to your friends, or a promise to your society - the following and comprehension of laws, and the willingness to abandon the law and those in charge when they provide not stability, but disorder and sadness. Because sometimes, things need to change - it’s not about blindly having responsibility, it’s about knowing the purpose of it, and through that knowledge, to do them dutifully. And responsibility without purpose is not worth following at all.

Blood players think about this a lot. They’re all perpetually stressed, because they know what they need to do and they focus on it. Sure, they have time for silly things, who doesn’t, but why pursue self-centered goals like emotional satisfaction and alone time when you could be passing around gifts with your family, you know? And all of this is important. Blood shares, and Blood cares (so does Breath, really, but they don’t care about everything). Blood holds the parties when no one else will while Breath invites friends and brings the soda. Blood organizes things and keeps the house tidy whereas Breath goes out to play with the kids. Blood does their homework and studies hard so that they can improve society itself, due to their intimate understanding of it while Breath plays video games and leaves it for last minute. Blood maintains connections while Breath makes new ones. But because Blood cares, Breath moves on while Blood dwells.  Blood stresses out over a change of direction, while Breath snaps on to another flow instantly.

It is worth noting that each pair is a balance. Breath is equally as capable of leadership as Blood is. But Breath doesn’t lead because they feel they need to. Breath leads because they see something new to change, because something’s holding them and their friends back from having fun, and that’s unforgivable. Breath picks up the weapon and defies the tyrant by themselves, and everyone follows full of inspiration. Additionally, Breath values its friends and is just as capable as Blood of caring deeply for them - it’s just that Blood takes the ‘WE NEED AN INTERVENTION’ approach and Breath takes the “let’s do a groupwatch!” approach.
Together with Breath, Blood and Breath make up the axis of Drive, operating on a Societal level.
