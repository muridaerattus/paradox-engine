Breath is about knowing what you want, what brings you personal satisfaction, having the freedom to pursue it, and detachment from such things such as social bonds, responsibility, and your own emotions. Breath players are not emotionless - actually, they can be one of the more emotionally outspoken Aspects, but for most Class combos for it, they only have one state and that state is ridiculously happy-go-lucky. 

However, when your goal is to pursue personal satisfaction, there are things that get in the way of that. Personal responsibility, and in the cases of those most unhealthy, upsetting emotions, stress, grim outlooks on life, disturbing conversations, and such other things. Breath players are masters at suppressing and subduing negative emotional responses, often doing so by repressing them into the ground, but also by being so focused on what makes them happy that they can acknowledge something as a Bad Thing and yet distinctly not care.

Moreover, Breath is also about quest. It’s about seeing something and going “I want to do that, that sounds fun” and walking to the ends of the Earth doing so, being friendly and affable to people on the way. Breath is flexible, it is able to change direction and flow at will and for any reason. Breath is charming, with their tendency to pull others into moments of their own personal satisfaction and general lack of emotional dwelling making others flock around Breath players. Breath is unrestrained and loathes any attempt at keeping it so, while also deeply concerned for the things that might just hold it at bay from pursuing their goal, even if for a second.

This is why Breath is the ‘protagonist’ Aspect. Breath players are flexible to use, adapting to new situations that the story calls for, are focused on a goal but perfectly willing to take detours and do silly things on the way, are relatable to a general audience or if not at the very least friendly and funny enough to make people go ‘haha I like this dude’, and do not dwell on the past for too long, allowing them to swiftly move on after an arc has concluded, even if particularly depressing.

Also, weird phenomenon, but Breath players like to pick one thing they really like and focus on it hard and have deeply complex emotions about it, more than such a thing would call for. 

It happens to Tavros with Pupa Pan, John Egbert with bad movies, Rufioh with troll anime, and me with human anime and this bullshit, with many other examples through fiction. In any case, insulting something that brings a Breath player personal satisfaction, esp. if they’re edgy, is a great way to earn yourself a place on their shitlist, which usually gets emptied out once every week anyway.
