Doom is sacrifice, systems, limitations, the expense of energy all at once to leave a stunted being that can never spend that much energy again. Doom players are not particularly self-sacrificial, that’s just one of the comic things. More commonly, Doom is represented by the limitation of agency through systems. Doom players have a flowchart brain (Doom and Time are considered to be ‘clockwork brains’ due to being galaxy-sized but also very systematized and almost robotic) and they tend to process life by expanding things out into many branches. Doom players also tend to systemize morality, and think in black and white (this thing bad, this thing good), though that’s not always easily apparent. They kin the ‘only Sith think in absolutes’ statement wholly, except they are the Sith.
Doom also has a lot to do with entropy, specifically chaos, and even more specifically, establishing order in what’s seen as chaotic. Doom players are fundamentally aware that the universe is uncertain and chaotic, where anything can happen and nothing is organized, and often seek to fix this, but the philosophy here is that wonderful things can only come out of chaos.

Doom has a relationship to death as a form of ultimate limitation. Specifically, Doom players believe that death is the main thing that pushes humans forward, that is to say, that without death, humans wouldn’t be motivated to pursue things, develop their knowledge of the world, and pass on a legacy. That’s an extension of what Doom players fundamentally believe, that restrictions and limitations are actually an important part of the world and how it functions, that without rules and consequences much of what we have accomplished and a lot of human happiness and philosophy would not matter at all. 

Together with Life, Doom and Life make the axis of Energy on the Physical scale.
