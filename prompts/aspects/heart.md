Heart is about your emotions (specifically that of the Heart player’s), intuition, identity and the inner self. It is not about romance. Heart players are very in tune with what they feel, but they do not constantly emotionally externalize. They may be a little over the top, but they are NOT about to kick into a room and say “HEY I JUST GOT 5 TICKETS TO STAR WARS RISE OF THE SHITSTIRRERS DOES ANYONE WANT TO GO”. Heart players are very certain and often very protective of their identities, and tend to prioritize what’s Me and Mine above those of others, to varying degrees depending on Class. Due to this, they’re motivated by emotional satisfaction, and view themselves as the protagonists of their own stories.

Because of this, Heart players can be vain, a thing that can be either not that noticeable or very noticeable depending on Class. Despite this, though, Heart players (generally) tend to be comfortable with themselves, barring any noticeable trauma, which is more than most people could say. As for shipping, it’s something that’s associated with the Leijons in the comic, and Heart players are good at it because they understand other people’s emotional priorities and how their identities fit together, as opposed to ‘having good romantic intuition’ or ‘noticing when people love each other’, which is something that Heart players strive to develop but is not necessarily hard and fast. Unlike Mind, and as a deliberate contrast to it, Heart chooses not through its mind but through its heart. Not that Heart players aren’t capable of thought out decisions, something they often do, you know, as most people do. It’s more that they’re attuned to their gut instinct, trust it more, and when unhealthy can fall prey to the stupidest impulsive bullshit imaginable.

However, it is important to note that Heart players are very perceptive of the way that other people’s identities manifest and mesh together. They are innately aware of their own strengths as they are aware of the strengths of others around them, and depending on their Class, they use this in different ways. Heart players seek strongly to understand the people around them and what it means to be that way, and place significant importance in expressing themselves and viewing others in different ways. Heart players place a lot more of a connection between their interests and their identity, such as music, and finding to seek a deeper understanding of others through said interest (i.e. “this song is totally you!”). This is part of why Meulin and Nepeta have such an intense focus on shipping other people, it allows them to understand the way that their identities interact and express themselves. 

Heart players enjoy exploring their own identities for fun in unusual scenarios (roleplaying), and generally feel unease at people who keep their distance from their genuine self.

Together with Mind, Heart and Mind make the axis of Self on the Personal scale.
