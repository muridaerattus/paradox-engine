Unlike many other Aspects, Hope really only has one concept word; it’s possibility. Specifically, many possibilities. Hope is what could be, it’s everything that could happen. It’s not even what’s possible, as much as it’s what could be conjured by your little human brain. It’s about choosing a possibility out of many, committing to it, and committing to it so strongly that you can make the impossible possible, but being completely ready to change that on a whim when a more convenient one appears, in fact Hope players find difficulty conceptualizing being stuck to a single possibility, it’s just that when they’re pursuing one there’s really no stopping them. This means that Hope players can be often inherently optimistic when not traumatized or depressed, as they’re able to pick themselves up from crappy situations by simply believing that things will get better no matter how bad.

It’s believing that the Sun is both a living creature made out of pure energy, but also a ball of plasma burning at millions of degrees in space. If Terezi sees the results of her decisions, and Vriska’s decisions, then a Seer of Hope sees all alternate possibilities. If Terezi sees her and Karkat’s bodies lying on the meteor, a Seer of Hope sees Bec Noir and Vriska sheathing their blades and sipping tea. It’s understanding the cruelty inherent to reality, the things that are undeniable and in front of you, and saying “I reject this”, and then working to the ends of the Earth to make it so. 

Hope, before settling on a possibility, is floaty and unfocused, frequently switching from thought to thought. When you talk to a Hope player, they can often lead you down many different paths, which can be problematic during a Classpecting session. They can go on unrelated tangents and can seem dreamy. Other times, they can be too rigid, committedly delusional to a fault. However, they’re thankfully very open-minded, and they can provide much needed new perspectives in a situation where it seems like there’s only a path forward. And hey, when everything’s gone to shit and everybody’s waiting to die, a Hope player may just carve a mountain in half just because they don’t want to accept that things are like this. 

Together with Rage, Hope and Rage make the axis of Possibility, on the Instinctual scale.
