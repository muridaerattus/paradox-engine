Light deals with importance, the flow of information, and relevance. Light and Void can be thought of in theatrical terms - Light being the spotlight, the main stage, the actor, whatever you may that you keep your eyes focused on, and Void the stagehands, the shadows surrounding the spotlight, the production crew, always unseen but essential nevertheless. Light players are always a little smug, believe that existence is defined by them, and place a great deal of focus on what’s apparent and important. Light has connections to information, specifically which information is relevant or which is not, that information allows you to become more relevant, and that wise important men are well, wise. Luck is not a concept related to Light in real life - Light players in real life are neither (un)lucky, nor do they necessarily always have to believe in luck. However, in the comic, Light is linked to luck because luck represents circumstantial importance, that the luckier person lets to survive the longest and pull off cooler stuff, making them inherently more relevant than those who are unlucky.  Light can also be like glass, transparent but precise. Or, if you’re dealing with one that’s particularly difficult to deal with, a glass shiv.

In that sense, it could be said that Light deals exclusively with what is important and that all other concepts are derived from that, but I’d say that information gets equal amounts of attention depending on the class. Seers of Light do certainly educate others on how to gain the most importance on occasion, but really the way they operate is by just sharing information in general, and the biggest part relevancy plays in that is the fact that they’re able to keep a reader engaged by knowing when to bring up certain information (that is relevant at that specific moment), when to discard certain information (that is not relevant at all to what they wish to communicate), and how to keep the person they’re trying to educate focused and engaged in what they have to say. Sylphs of Light operate on a similar principle, though they deal with ‘look at me’ more closely than Seers of Light, and this can apply for many other Light classes like Mage.
Together with Void, Light and Void make the axis of Importance, on the Philosophical scale.
