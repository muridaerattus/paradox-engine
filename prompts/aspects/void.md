Void is about irrelevance and secrets (information that is not known), mystery, nothingness and the potential contained within. It has no relation to bad luck, but you could use the same argument for circumstantial importance for it.

Void players are paranoid, deprioritize their own opinions and worldview in relation to learnt behaviors which leads to more apparent shadows and forced states, are often inscrutable, enjoy attention but do not enjoy the spotlight, desire recognition but are fundamentally horrified that nothing they’ve done, liked, or that their existence even matters, that your opinions are naught but a thought in a sea of endless others. Void is not about that which doesn’t exist or can never be known - it is what is unseen but felt, the obscured event horizon of a black hole that can still be ‘seen’ through the distortion it causes on its surroundings and the emissions of its radiation. Their worldview is a big fat ‘whatever’, because it doesn’t really matter if they’re still going to be doing the things they’re going to do anyway. People frequently forget Void players exist, and they generally keep their existence lowkey, as they prioritize it less compared to that of others. If you have a Void friend that you’ve known for a long time, ask yourself if you know anything particularly personal about them - chances are you don’t.

It is information that is unknown to you, but that you know exists. That it’s out there, the diary hidden under a secret compartment, locked with a key. Information you want to know, information you need to know, but that you can never reach because it is so beyond you. Every lie ever uttered and every secret ever kept, the hand underneath the puppet, the personality cloaked under a veil (not a facade!) that runs so deep and is so carefully constructed to not show that which shouldn’t be known that it fundamentally cannot be parsed. It’s as much the ocean, full of infinite, untapped potential, as much as it’s the shade cast by a park bench. Void provides the necessary contrast for Light to exist, and without it nothing would be truly important. Because if everything is important and seen, nothing is.
Together with Light, Void and Light make the axis of Importance, on the Philosophical scale.
