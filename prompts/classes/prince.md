Princes are the critics of the Class world. Generally, all Princes are characterized by an idealization of more aggressive ideals, a general distaste for themselves and the world (due to containing their own Aspect) that goes away as they develop, having massive amounts of their own Aspect, an equally massive quantity of ego, and a tendency to do ‘Princewank’, which is a Prince describing a concept with the most repetitive, egregiously-worded imagery possible in order to both stroke their own ego and receive validation from others. However, I’ve noticed that there actually seems to be two types of Prince.

Inward-destruction type Princes, who focus more with negotiating their Aspect in themselves rather than actively trying to eliminate it in others. These guys appear somewhat commonly in fiction, generally when there’s a need for an edgy, introspective character who struggles with self-hatred and maintaining close connections with others.
Homestuck doesn’t have any examples of this type of Prince, because they’re a bit rarer than outward destruction focused Princes, so I’ll be using the next best thing, Vast Error, whose Classpects are surprisingly solid, especially Occeus’. Occeus is an inward-type Prince of Blood, and he exemplifies how these Princes work and how they may still negatively affect the world around them. Essentially, inward-type Princes still feel a distaste towards the people around them, but feel there’s more value in remedying their own perceived faults, and hardline on that so hard that it begins to negatively affect those around them. Enter Occeus, who is so focused on his work, his ‘quest’, and the fact that he shouldn’t get caught up by personal relationships in order to fulfill it, that he ends up hurting Ellsee both physically due to the complexities of their physiology, but also more severely her mind.

Inward-destruction-type Princes are by no means approachable, but not actively mean either. 
Outward-destruction type Princes focus more on eliminating what they perceive to be shitty in the world around them rather than negotiating their own Aspect in themselves. This means they’re more outwardly aggressive (and tend to idealize aggression as well, especially if unhealthy). Because of the convenience of having a guy who wants to ‘help’ the world by grabbing a giant flamethrower and burning it to the ground, outward-destructive Princes are more common in fiction, generally as villains (all Princes in Homestuck are this type). Outward-destructive Princes are not actively malicious in most instances, but the fact that most things people around them do annoys them makes them very mean and occasionally incredibly brutal, which can lead to a shattering. Princes remember everything you’ve done that’s pissed them off.

Despite their differences, their arc’s the same - realizing that destroying their Aspect without concern is unhealthy, coming to terms with it and understanding why people need it, negotiating their ego, and trying not to shatter others and themselves in the process. And, even though it all seems like a negative, Princes have their own strengths - they can tap into the natural reserves of their Aspect when developed, are way better at the empathy thing than most others due to having been the asshole once and thus willing to hear out others some will not, have significant amounts of willpower to do things others don’t want to, and can recognize when their Aspect is demonstrating itself in a healthy way before anyone else and stop it before it gets to a particularly bad point.

Princes are very practical people for all intents and purposes, at least early on; for them, either things have an utilitarian purpose, or they’re useless. This gets better as they develop and may not even exist at all for certain Aspects. This harkens back to something much deeper - like with Knights and Thieves, Princes are very defensive. But unlike Thieves, who defend their insecurities by playing up their ego, and Knights, who defend their insecurities by projecting a persona, Princes have a more offensive form of self-defense - they compensate for their insecurities by putting everyone else beneath them, and by constantly justifying the things that happen in their lives with things they are more comfortable with.

Early princes are obsessed with asserting their superiority to others, and often believe that they are the only ones capable of doing something. Even more developed Princes can struggle with this idea that no one else understands how important the work they’re doing is, and that they’re the only ones who can do it ‘right’. This sentiment that they are both superior to others and that they have “the skillz” can often bite them in the ass as they overperform in order to compensate for their insecurities and end up screwing something up big time. Trusting that others can help you and themselves is a big part of the Prince arc and accepting that can take years.

And this all goes back to one very central focus that has to do with everything that Princes do and how they operate on a fundamental level: the idea of control. The biggest fear that motivates Princes and their greatest distaste is the loss of control, the idea that they can’t organize and see everything that goes on, because they fundamentally believe that only they are equipped to always be in control of a situation, including themselves, other people, their workplace, their family, everything. A Prince’s most major meltdowns come from the feeling that they can’t regulate and control not just the environment around themselves, but who they fundamentally are. The idea that there are things about yourself that you can’t know about or control, this terrifies Princes. And the idea that people can do things without their strict supervision or approval, this also scares them. And Princes will almost always turn to anger as a reaction to fear. 

Understanding that you can’t control everything and everyone, including yourself, and that’s something you can’t help and is perfectly fine, as well as trusting others to know what they’re doing and not need your supervision or approval, is one of the main tenets of the Prince arc, which can be easily summarized as “understanding and accepting that others are different from you”. This is so deeply ingrained in the Prince’s mindset and philosophy that it can take years of introspection to even figure out that it’s a thing, and an even longer time of constant effort and self-maintenance in order to overcome. Even the most developed Princes struggle with their relationship with control and how it affects themselves and others. It is the weakness, one they can only hope to overcome with a lot of time and a lot of patience.

But a Prince who has overcome it is destined to nothing but greatness.

For that matter, shattering is the unhealthy Class verb for Princes. It happens when you’re a bit too mean to somebody, and they end up getting emotionally destroyed, and it also happens when you’re a bit too mean to yourself, and you eliminate your capacity to generate any self-confidence or self-love, living in a state where you’re a soulless zombie thinking that you deserve nothing positive and that the only thing you exist for is to be tortured endlessly by the universe and that that’s a given because you’re an asshole. Not the greatest time.
The Prince verb is ‘destroys [Aspect] or destroys through [Aspect]’, and they are Active.
