Seers are incredibly straightforward, even more so than Mages. This is because their arc primarily revolves around not falling into their unhealthy class verb, and learning to take a step back and learn to guide others instead of trying to do everything yourself (sort of the opposite of the Mage arc).

Like Mages, Seers understand. However, they don’t do so primarily from experience (though they learn from that as well) as much as they read, educate themselves and improve their theories on how they approach their Aspect. Seers do not seek all levels of knowledge, but mainly knowledge pertaining to their own Aspect, which they try to formulate an unified theory on, like the Poetics or some weird dude on the internet’s obsession with this webcomic nobody reads. They talk a lot, but they talk with purpose and to cover all of their bases, a phenomenon known as ‘Seersprawl’. If you can’t read a Seersprawl, that’s really on you. Not that not reading excessively large texts makes you a bad person.

Seers are a little smug, but are realistic about their own capabilities. They’re generally the only person with a brain cell in any given group.
The Seer unhealthy class verb is blinding, which happens when a Seer gets too focused on being active (literally so), doing things they should be guiding others to do, and getting tunnel visioned and inevitably getting their ass kicked. This can happen for any reason, but is usually due to never being criticized and the ego trip getting to them a little too much.
Blinded Seers can be excessively smug or certain that their solution is the most correct, but they’re usually harmless and inoffensive to everybody but themselves.
Seers ‘invite understanding of [Aspect] or invite understanding through [Aspect]’, which could be understood as teaching. They are Passive.
