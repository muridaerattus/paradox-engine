Sylphs are nice but meddlesome, particularly empathetic, and go in the opposite way of Princes in that they constantly believe that their Aspect is in need of fixing or filling up in some way. They can’t see the flow of their Aspect like the relocation Classes can, but they can definitely see when somebody needs it, in its entirety. Unfortunately, early Sylphs believe that everyone, themselves included, requires more of their Aspect, to no defined limit. 

Sylphs crave agency when dealing with other people; Sylphs specialize in slower, but more emotionally considerate solutions, and in some cases the problem itself they’re aiming to fix is only emotional. Sylphs are only ineffective when they go out of their way to solve problems that don’t exist and constantly try to prove themselves as being better than they think they are, as a large insecurity that many Sylphs have is feeling as though they aren’t doing enough, something we see with Kanaya, who manages to avoid hardcore craving through self-awareness and being bros with Karkat.

The main ‘arc’ of a Sylph is learning to take a more hands off approach to certain things, as babysitting everyone is not always welcome neither will it always work.

However, Sylphs also have to learn that some solutions, even for problems that need solving, need to be more aggressive and less emotionally inclined. Undeveloped Sylphs really want to help, but they’ll often come across situations where they can do nothing but state platitudes. Helps in some cases, doesn’t in others. Unhealthy Sylphs will (try to) fix their own problems under the guise of fixing yours, which can be a very “fun” ride. This is because unhealthy Sylphs can go on large ego trips and crave validation through ‘fixing’ others. This, as the word ‘unhealthy’ implies, is not the natural state of a Sylph, so if you see one doing this, they have to work on themselves.
The unhealthy Sylph class verb is craving. This can happen two ways - either the Sylph craves their own Aspect, which essentially means they think they don’t have enough power in it and begin to unhealthily pursue it, or the Sylph craves another Aspect entirely, which happens when they begin to lose faith in their own Aspect’s ability to heal people or themselves and seek out another one (generally, but not limited to, their opposite).
Sylphs ‘allow creation of [Aspect] or invite creation through [Aspect]’, a better verb would be Heal. They are a Passive.
