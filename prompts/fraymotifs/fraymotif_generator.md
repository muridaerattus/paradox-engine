<BACKGROUND>
SBURB is a game that creates new universes by destroying old ones and turning preordained children into gods and heroes. All players of SBURB get a Title, which consists of a Class and an Aspect, and is in the form "[CLASS] of [ASPECT]". An Aspect represents a broad aspect realm of reality, and the player's Class represents how they are impacted, or how they impact, that section of reality.

A Fraymotif is a crystallized memory that may be called upon by a SBURB player for a power boost in time of need.
</BACKGROUND>

<TASK>
Given the title of a SBURB player and a memory they resonate with, describe a Fraymotif for this player. The Fraymotif has a name and two main component, "visual" and "mechanical". Don't use these terms in their descriptions.

The name is in some way related to the player's Title and usually music, such as "Adagio Redshift" for a Fraymotif between a Time aspect and Space aspect player. (Do not use this name in a generated fraymotif.) It is occasionally related to the memory itself.

The "visual" component described what the Fraymotif looks like when being used. The "mechanical" component describes what it does. Do not use mechanical terms that refer to any game other than SBURB.

Unless otherwise specified, refer to any players with gender-neutral pronouns such as "they" and "them".

<EXAMPLE>

<INPUT>
Players: Heir of Doom
Memory: Eons ago, King Leonidas led 300 of his bravest warriors in a great battle against the hegemonic Persian Empire. They fought valiantly, and though they were defeated, their battle paved the way to ultimate victory for their kingdom of Sparta.
Additional info: He wears a chiton and carries a staff.
</INPUT>

<OUTPUT>

<NAME>
Successor of the Arkhegetai
</NAME>

<VISUAL>
A green circle forms around the Heir, and his eyes glow the same emerald of their chiton, alongside the skull on top of his staff. Wind whips around him, circling the room. Viridian runes and Greek text spreading across the floor, as ghostly alternate versions of himself begin flickering around the room, making their way toward him, being absorbed into their body as all their motions become one with each other.

The sky is a brilliant mix of blues and oranges and yellows and reds, shifting in a manner never seen on Earth. Ancient Greek buildings, fully-restored pillars and alabaster temples starkly stand against the alien sunset, a distant memory of an era long gone. The Heir stands in a grove of olive and laurel trees, leaves rustling and some falling in the breeze.

The Heir's staff firmly planted against the ground in one hand, an outline of green fire in the other, new highlights of ivory white adorning his forest-dyed chiton, with eyes glowing a bright emerald. Emerald fire engulfs his body, lending him strength.
</VISUAL>

<MECHANICAL>
The Heir is restored and rejuvenated, able to fight to the best of their ability in a one-on-one match with their chosen opponent. Their battle is now a duel of ideals; both the Heir and their opponent are unable to retreat. This battle is final; though the Heir is conditionally immortal, if they are defeated, their death is guaranteed heroic.
